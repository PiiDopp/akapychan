    "description": "You are given two integer arrays persons and times. In an election, the ith vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].\n\nFor each query at a time t, find the person that was leading the election at time t. Votes cast at time t will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.\n\nImplement the TopVotedCandidate class:\n\nTopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) Initializes the object with the persons and times arrays.\nint q(int t) Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time t according to the mentioned rules.",
