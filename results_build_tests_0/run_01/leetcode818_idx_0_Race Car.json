    "description": "Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):\n\nWhen you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:\nposition += speed\nspeed *= 2\nWhen you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:\nIf your speed is positive then speed = -1\notherwise speed = 1\nYour position stays the same.\nFor example, after commands \"AAR\", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.\n\nGiven a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.",
