    "title": "Open the Lock",
    "description": "You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.\n\nThe lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.\n\nYou are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.\n\nGiven a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.",

      {
        "input": "deadends = [\"0201\",\"0101\",\"0102\",\"1212\",\"2002\"], target = \"0202\"",
        "output": "6",
        "explanation": "A sequence of valid moves would be \"0000\" -> \"1000\" -> \"1100\" -> \"1200\" -> \"1201\" -> \"1202\" -> \"0202\".\nA sequence like \"0000\" -> \"0001\" -> \"0002\" -> \"0102\" -> \"0202\" would be invalid, because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end \"0102\"."

      {
        "input": "deadends = [\"8888\"], target = \"0009\"",

        "output": "-1",
