    "title": "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee",
    "description": "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.\\n\\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.\\n\\nNote:\\n- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\\n- The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.",

        "input": "prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2",

        "explanation": "Buying at prices[0] = 1, selling at prices[3] = 8, buying at prices[4] = 4, selling at prices[5] = 9. Total profit = ((8-1)-2) + ((9-4)-2) = 8."
