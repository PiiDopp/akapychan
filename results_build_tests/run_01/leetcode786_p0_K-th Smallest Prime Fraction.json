    "title": "K-th Smallest Prime Fraction",
    "description": "You are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. \nYou are also given an integer k.\n\nFor every i and j where 0 <= i < j < arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].\n\nReturn the k^th smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].",
    "examples": [
      {
        "input": "arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3",

        "explanation": "The fractions to be considered in sorted order are: 1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3. The third fraction is 2/5."
