    "title": "Next Greater Element I",
    "description": "The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.\n\nYou are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.\n\nFor each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.\n\nReturn an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.",

        "explanation": "The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:\n- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.\n- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.\n- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1."
