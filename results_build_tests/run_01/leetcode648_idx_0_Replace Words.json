    "title": "Replace Words",
    "description": "In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root \"help\" is followed by the word \"ful\", we can form a derivative \"helpful\".\n\nGiven a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.\n\nReturn the sentence after the replacement.",
