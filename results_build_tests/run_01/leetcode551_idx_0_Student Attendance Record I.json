    "description": "You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:\n\n'A': Absent.\n'L': Late.\n'P': Present.\nThe student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:\n\nThe student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.\nThe student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.\nReturn true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.",
