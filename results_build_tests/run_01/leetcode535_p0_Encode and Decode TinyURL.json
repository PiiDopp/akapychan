    "title": "Encode and Decode TinyURL",
    "description": "Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.\nTinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.\n\nThere is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.\n\nImplement the Solution class:\n\nSolution() Initializes the object of the system.\nString encode(String longUrl) Returns a tiny URL for the given longUrl.\nString decode(String shortUrl) Returns the original long URL for the given shortUrl. It is guaranteed that the given shortUrl was encoded by the same object.",
