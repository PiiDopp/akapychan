    "title": "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array",
    "description": "Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:\n\n[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.\n[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.\nNotice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].\n\nGiven the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.",
