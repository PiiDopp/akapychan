    "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index. \n\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.",
