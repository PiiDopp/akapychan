    "title": "Lemonade Change",
    "description": "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\n\nNote that you do not have any change in hand at first.\n\nGiven an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "input": "bills = [5,5,5,10,20]",
        "output": "true",
        "explanation": "From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.\nFrom the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\nFrom the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\nSince all customers got correct change, we output true."

        "explanation": "From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.\nFor the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\nFor the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.\nSince not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false."
