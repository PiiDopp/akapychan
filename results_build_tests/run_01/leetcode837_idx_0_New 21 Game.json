    "description": "Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game \"21\".\n\nAlice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.\n\nAlice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.\n\nReturn the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.\n\nAnswers within 10^-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.",
