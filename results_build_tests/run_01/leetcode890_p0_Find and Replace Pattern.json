    "title": "Find and Replace Pattern",
    "description": "Given a list of strings words and a string pattern, return a list of words[i] that match pattern. You may return the answer in any order.\n\nA word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.\n\nRecall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "input": "words = [\"abc\",\"deq\",\"mee\",\"aqq\",\"dkd\",\"ccc\"], pattern = \"abb\"",
        "output": "[\"mee\",\"aqq\"]",
        "explanation": "\"mee\" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. \n\"ccc\" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter."
