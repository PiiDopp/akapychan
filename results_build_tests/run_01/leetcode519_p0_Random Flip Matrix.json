    "title": "Random Flip Matrix",
    "description": "There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.\n\nOptimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.\n\nImplement the Solution class:\n\nSolution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.\nint[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.\nvoid reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.",
